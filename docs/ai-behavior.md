# AI Behavior Design

## ü§ñ AI Philosophy

### Core Principles

#### **Believable Behavior**
- AI actions should feel logical and intentional
- Enemies react appropriately to player actions
- Behavior matches character/creature type
- Consistent personality traits

#### **Engaging Challenge**
- Provide appropriate difficulty for player skill level
- Create opportunities for player tactical thinking
- Avoid frustrating or unfair behavior
- Reward player skill and preparation

#### **Performance Efficiency**
- AI decisions must be computed quickly
- Scalable to many simultaneous AI entities
- Predictable computational complexity
- Graceful degradation under load

## üå≥ Behavior Tree Architecture

### Basic Node Types

#### **Composite Nodes**

##### **Selector (OR)**
- Executes children left-to-right until one succeeds
- Use for: Priority-based decision making
- Example: Attack > Heal > Defend

##### **Sequence (AND)**
- Executes children left-to-right until one fails
- Use for: Multi-step actions
- Example: Approach > Aim > Shoot

##### **Parallel**
- Executes multiple children simultaneously
- Use for: Concurrent behaviors
- Example: Move + Scan for enemies

#### **Decorator Nodes**

##### **Inverter**
- Reverses success/failure of child
- Use for: Negative conditions
- Example: "Not in combat"

##### **Repeater**
- Repeats child behavior N times or until failure
- Use for: Persistent actions
- Example: Patrol route

##### **Cooldown**
- Prevents execution for specified time after success
- Use for: Ability limitations
- Example: Special attack cooldowns

#### **Leaf Nodes**

##### **Condition**
- Check game state (HP, distance, etc.)
- Returns success/failure
- Example: "Health below 25%"

##### **Action**
- Perform specific behavior
- May take multiple frames to complete
- Example: "Move to target", "Cast spell"

### Example Behavior Tree

```
Guard Behavior
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Selector
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence [Combat Behavior]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Condition: "Enemy in sight"
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Selector
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence [Ranged Attack]
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Condition: "Has ranged weapon"
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Condition: "Enemy in range"
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Action: "Shoot at enemy"
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Action: "Move toward enemy"
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence [Patrol]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Condition: "Not alerted"
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Action: "Follow patrol route"
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Action: "Idle animation"
```
