# Balance & Tuning Design

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Philosophy

### Core Principles

#### **Meaningful Choices**
- Every character build should have viable paths to success
- Trade-offs create interesting strategic decisions
- No single "best" solution to all challenges
- Player skill can overcome statistical disadvantages

#### **Emergent Complexity**
- Simple rules combine to create complex interactions
- Mastery comes from understanding system interactions
- Depth emerges from player experimentation
- Edge cases create interesting gameplay moments

#### **Fair Challenge**
- Player failure should feel instructive, not arbitrary
- Success requires skill, preparation, or smart tactics
- RNG enhances rather than dominates outcomes
- Comeback mechanics prevent snowballing

## üìà Statistical Framework

### Baseline Metrics

#### **Character Power Levels**
```
Level 1 Baseline:
- Health: 100 HP
- Damage: 10-15 per attack
- Accuracy: 75%
- Defense: 12 AC
- Critical: 5% chance, 2x damage
```

#### **Scaling Factors**
```
Per Level Progression:
- Health: +8-12 HP
- Damage: +1-2 points
- Accuracy: +1-2%
- Defense: +0.5-1 AC
- Critical: +0.2% chance
```

#### **Encounter Difficulty**
```
Relative to Party Level:
- Trivial: 50% of party power
- Easy: 75% of party power
- Moderate: 100% of party power
- Hard: 125% of party power
- Deadly: 150%+ of party power
```

### Mathematical Models

#### **Damage Per Turn (DPT)**
```
DPT = (Hit_Chance √ó Average_Damage) + (Crit_Chance √ó Crit_Bonus)

Example:
DPT = (0.75 √ó 12.5) + (0.05 √ó 12.5) = 9.375 + 0.625 = 10
```

#### **Effective Health Points (EHP)**
```
EHP = Actual_HP √ó (1 + Damage_Reduction + Avoidance)

Example:
EHP = 100 √ó (1 + 0.2 + 0.1) = 100 √ó 1.3 = 130
```

#### **Time To Kill (TTK)**
```
TTK = Target_EHP / Attacker_DPT

Example:
TTK = 130 / 10 = 13 turns
```

## üéØ Class Balance

### Role Effectiveness

#### **Tank Archetype**
- **Primary Function**: Damage mitigation, threat generation
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Damage absorbed vs. party members
  - Uptime in combat encounters
  - Threat generation efficiency
- **Balance Targets**:
  - 2-3x effective health of damage dealers
  - 50-70% damage output of pure DPS
  - High threat generation abilities

#### **Damage Dealer (DPS)**
- **Primary Function**: Enemy elimination
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Damage per turn output
  - Ability to handle various enemy types
  - Resource efficiency
- **Balance Targets**:
  - 150-200% damage of tank classes
  - 70-80% survivability of tanks
  - Efficient resource-to-damage ratios

#### **Support/Healer**
- **Primary Function**: Team enhancement, healing
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Healing per turn capability
  - Buff/debuff effectiveness
  - Team survival improvement
- **Balance Targets**:
  - Healing output matches incoming damage
  - Meaningful buff/debuff effects
  - 60-80% individual combat effectiveness

### Multiclass Considerations

#### **Hybrid Classes**
- **Power Budget**: 80% effectiveness in each role
- **Unique Strengths**: Abilities unavailable to pure classes
- **Trade-offs**: Less specialized but more flexible
- **Balancing Method**: Ensure hybrids excel in specific situations

## üîÑ Progression Balance

### Power Curve Design

#### **Linear Growth**
```
Character Power = Base_Power + (Level √ó Growth_Rate)
```
- Predictable progression
- Easy to balance across level ranges
- Prevents massive power gaps

#### **Milestone Progression**
```
Major Power Increases at Levels: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20
Minor Improvements: All other levels
```
- Creates meaningful upgrade moments
- Maintains engagement between milestones
- Allows for significant mechanical changes

### Attribute Scaling

#### **Diminishing Returns**
```
Attribute Effectiveness:
1-10: 100% efficiency
11-15: 80% efficiency  
16-20: 60% efficiency
21+: 40% efficiency
```

#### **Specialization vs. Generalization**
- **Focused Builds**: High effectiveness in narrow areas
- **Balanced Builds**: Moderate effectiveness across all areas
- **Design Goal**: Both approaches remain viable

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Encounter Balance

### Encounter Design Framework

#### **Action Economy**
```
Party Actions per Turn: 4 (assuming 4-person party)
Enemy Actions per Turn: Should approximate party total

Single Powerful Enemy: 3-4 actions
Multiple Weak Enemies: 1 action each, 4-6 total
Mixed Groups: Balanced to total 3-5 actions
```

#### **Resource Depletion**
- **Short Encounters**: 25-40% resource expenditure
- **Medium Encounters**: 50-70% resource expenditure  
- **Long Encounters**: 80-100% resource expenditure
- **Epic Encounters**: May require resource management across phases

### Enemy Design Balance

#### **Solo Boss Encounters**
- **Health**: 3-4x single party member health
- **Damage**: Spread across multiple attacks to avoid one-shots
- **Special Abilities**: Phase-based mechanics, area denial
- **Action Economy**: Multiple actions per turn or legendary actions

#### **Group Encounters**
- **Mixed Composition**: Different enemy roles (tank, DPS, support)
- **Synergy Effects**: Enemies that enhance each other
- **Priority Targets**: Clear tactical choices for players
- **Scalability**: Easy addition/removal for difficulty adjustment

### Environmental Factors

#### **Terrain Advantages**
- **High Ground**: +10% damage, +5% accuracy
- **Cover**: -25% ranged accuracy
- **Difficult Terrain**: -50% movement speed
- **Hazards**: Environmental damage sources

#### **Interactive Elements**
- **Destructible Cover**: Changes tactical landscape
- **Activatable Traps**: Player-triggered advantages
- **Dynamic Hazards**: Moving threats requiring positioning

## üéÆ Player Feedback Integration

## üìä Specific Balance Targets

### Damage Dealer Balance

#### **Burst vs. Sustained Damage**
```
Burst DPS (over 3 turns): 150% of sustained
Sustained DPS (over 10+ turns): Baseline
Resource Efficiency: Burst uses 200% resources
```

#### **Single Target vs. Area Damage**
```
Single Target: 100% damage efficiency
Small AoE (2-3 targets): 80% per target
Large AoE (4+ targets): 60% per target
```

### Defensive Ability Balance

#### **Damage Reduction vs. Avoidance**
```
Damage Reduction: Reliable, consistent mitigation
Avoidance: Variable, potentially higher mitigation
Balance Point: Same average damage reduction
```

#### **Active vs. Passive Defense**
```
Active Defense: Higher peak mitigation, resource cost
Passive Defense: Lower consistent mitigation, no cost
Opportunity Cost: Active defense prevents other actions
```

### Support Ability Balance

#### **Healing vs. Buffing**
```
Direct Healing: Immediate health restoration
Buffing: Damage prevention through enhancement
Efficiency Target: Similar net health preservation
```

#### **Single Target vs. Group Support**
